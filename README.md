Class notes for AAEC (STAT) 4804 & AAEC 5804G -- Elementary & Fundamentals of Econometrics 

This is the landing page for Introductory and Fundamental Econometrics. I will update this document weekly with relevant links to course notes and associated class materials. It would be in your best interest to "watch" this repository so that you can receive instant notifications of changes I make. The Chapters referenced below correspond to those in Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, 7th Ed., by Jeff Wooldridge.
